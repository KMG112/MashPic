Welcome <br />
Mash pic takes input from a user in a 'madlibs' format, and creates a new picture based on user input. For example a template looks like this.<br />
"I want to see a _________ riding a ________ while in ______"<br />
"I want to see a ___cat__ riding a _monkey__ while in _space__"<br />
using an image API the program will return an image that is a representation of what the user inputted.
